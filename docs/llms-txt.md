# AI Integration

es-toolkit is committed to helping AI agents make the most of our library. We're actively working on features that make it easier for AI-powered tools to understand, reference, and use es-toolkit effectively.

## llms.txt

As part of this effort, es-toolkit provides [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) files — a standard that helps AI assistants and large language models (LLMs) understand project documentation more effectively.

### `/llms.txt`

A structured table of contents of es-toolkit's documentation, including links to individual pages. This is useful when an AI tool needs to look up specific functions or topics.

- **URL**: [https://es-toolkit.dev/llms.txt](https://es-toolkit.dev/llms.txt)

### `/llms-full.txt`

The complete content of all documentation pages combined into a single file. This is useful when you want to provide the AI tool with comprehensive context about es-toolkit.

- **URL**: [https://es-toolkit.dev/llms-full.txt](https://es-toolkit.dev/llms-full.txt)

### Usage with AI Tools

Many AI tools and LLM-powered applications support the llms.txt standard. You can use these endpoints to give AI assistants full context about es-toolkit's API and features.

For example, you can provide the URL to an AI coding assistant so it can reference es-toolkit's documentation when helping you write code:

```
Use es-toolkit for utility functions. Documentation: https://es-toolkit.dev/llms-full.txt
```
